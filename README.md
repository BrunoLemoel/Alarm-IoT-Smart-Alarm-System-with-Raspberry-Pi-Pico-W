# Alarm-IoT-Smart-Alarm-System-with-Raspberry-Pi-Pico-W
This project implements a complete IoT alarm system using the Raspberry Pi Pico W microcontroller. The system is capable of real-time monitoring, activating physical devices (relay, buzzer, LED), displaying information on an LCD, measuring temperature via an NTC sensor, and connecting to a Wi-Fi network for future IoT integrations.
